## ü§π‚Äç What is React Albus?
React Albus is a React component library used to build declarative multi-step journeys (also known as Wizards).  You define your step content and ordering and React Albus will manage the journey-related state for you.

React Albus is otherwise unopinionated and allows you to compose functionality such as routing, animation, and analytics however you see fit.

## üíª Installation

```
npm install react-albus
```

## üìò Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Wizard, Steps, Step } from 'react-albus';

const Example = () => (
  <Wizard>
    <Steps>
      <Step
        id="merlin"
        render={({ next }) => (
          <div>
            <h1>Merlin</h1>
            <button onClick={next}>Next</button>
          </div>
        )}
      />
      <Step
        id="gandalf"
        render={({ next, previous }) => (
          <div>
            <h1>Gandalf</h1>
            <button onClick={next}>Next</button>
            <button onClick={previous}>Previous</button>
          </div>
        )}
      />
      <Step
        id="dumbledore"
        render={({ previous }) => (
          <div>
            <h1>Dumbledore</h1>
            <button onClick={previous}>Previous</button>
          </div>
        )}
      />
    </Steps>
  </Wizard>
);

export default Example;
```

## üéõÔ∏è API

- [`<Wizard>`](#wizard)
- [`<Steps>`](#steps)
- [`<Step>`](#step)
- [`withWizard`](#withwizard)
- [`wizardShape`](#wizardShape)
- [`context.wizard`](#contextwizard)

---

### `<Wizard>`

#### Props
##### `onNext(wizard)`: function *(optional)*
A function that will be called by `<Wizard>` to determine the next step to proceed to.

##### Params

* `wizard` (object): The [`context.wizard`](#contextwizard) object.

If you do not pass an `onNext` prop, `<Wizard>` will proceed directly to the next step.

##### `render(wizard)`: function *(optional)*
A function that will be used as the render function of `<Wizard>`.

##### Params
* `wizard` (object): The [`context.wizard`](#contextwizard) object.

---

### `<Steps>`
Wraps all of the `<Step>` components in your journey.  The only direct children of `<Steps>` should be `<Step>` components.

#### Props
##### `step`: object ***(optional)***
An object describing the current step with the structure: `{ id: string }`.  Defining a `step` prop will make `<Steps>` a [controlled component](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html).

------

### `<Step>`

Wraps all the content that will be conditionally shown when the step is active.

#### Props

##### `id`: string

Unique key for each step.

In addition to `id`, any additional props added to `<Step>` will be available on each `step` object.  This can be used to add names, descriptions, or other metadata to each step.

`<WithWizard>` is an alias for `<Step>` that can be used to access [`context.wizard`](#contextwizard) anywhere within the `<Wizard>` tree.

---

### `withWizard()`
A higher order component that adds [`context.wizard`](#contextwizard) as a `wizard  ` prop on the wrapped component.

---

### `context.wizard`
`<Wizard>` provides an object on context with the following properties:

* `step` (object): Describes the current step with structure: `{ id: string }`.
* `steps` (array): Array of `step` objects in the order they were declared within `<Steps>`.
* `history` (object): The backing [`history`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/history#properties) object.
* `next()` (function): Moves to the next step in order.
* `previous()` (function): Moves to the previous step in order.
* `go(n)` (function): Moves `n` steps in history.
* `push(id)` (function): Pushes the step with corresponding `id` onto history.
* `replace(id)` (function): Replaces the current step in history with the step with corresponding `id`.
* `set(id)` (function): Move to step `id`.

## üìò Usage with React Router

Internally, React Albus uses [history](https://github.com/ReactTraining/history) to maintain the ordering of steps.  This makes integrating with React Router (or any other router) as easy as providing `<Wizard>` with `history` and `basename` props.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Wizard } from 'react-albus';

const RoutedWizard = ({ children }) =>
  <Route
    render={({ history, match: { url } }) =>
      <Wizard history={history} basename={url}>
        {children}
      </Wizard>}
  />;

export default RoutedWizard;
```
